    'Lucid Dreaming is the proven ability to become "self-aware" in your dreams, allowing you to control them and do almost anything within your mind.',
    'The answer is dream recall. The more you can remember from dreaming, the more likely you are to identify that you are dreaming.',
    'Just like Lucid Dreaming, the more you practice remembering your dreams, the easier it becomes to remember! Once you get good at remembering dreams, Lucid Dreaming is only a few steps away.',
    'Dream recall is much easier when there are emotions and details involved. How did you feel in the dream? As vividly as possible, what setting were you in? Who, by name, do you remember being there?'
